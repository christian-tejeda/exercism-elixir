# Elixir code challenges repo

Code challenges from Exercism's Elixir track, dedicated to learning and applying Elixir and functional programming concepts. These range from basic and introductory to harder problems.

Each folder contains a README.md file that explains what the challenge is about and where to look for it's particular solution, as some of the code is boilerplate from Exercism.
